# UART-Communication-System
•	Implemented bidirectional communication between NUC140 microcontroller and PC using UART protocol through a USB-UART adapter.
•	Configured UART0 channel with precise timing parameters (115200 bps, 8-bit data frame).
•	Implemented interrupt-driven TX/RX handlers to manage data transmission.
•	Achieved reliable message exchange with proper start/stop bit sequencing (e.g., “hello” message).
•	Utilized oscilloscope to capture and analyze UART data waveforms for protocol verification.
